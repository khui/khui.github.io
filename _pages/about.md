I am an Applied Scientist from Amazon Alexa AI Search, working on question answering and information retrieval. Before that, I worked for SAP in its deep learning team, developing computer vision models for enterprise software. I got my Ph.D. from Max-Planck Institute for Informatics, where I worked on neural IR models and IR evaluation. My research mainly focuses on the deep learning models for ad-hoc information retrieval. I co-authored more than twenty peer-reviewed research papers. I also serve as program committee members, editorial board members, and reviewers for academic conferences and journals.
